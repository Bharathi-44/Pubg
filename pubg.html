    <p><span style="font-size:200%">H</span>urray... We are so glad to conduct the most played and enjoyable e-sport of the year PUBG-Player Unknown's BattleGround.</p>
<p>The fact that anyone can download and play PUBG Mobile is now commonly known. The battle royale game is free to download from the Google Playstore and Apple Appstore.  It’s just as easy to find friends to play with in the game, and slightly more difficult to win a Chicken Dinner. While playing the game casually is super fun, PUBG Mobile is also played professionally these days in official tournaments like PUBG Mobile India Series that recently concluded with the winning team taking home Rs 30 lakhs in cash! These are large scale tournaments where players from all over the country participate. There are global tournaments as well where every region where PUBG Mobile is available take part. Now, we understand it’s not always possible for every player to participate in these tournaments, but that shouldn’t stop you from having fun playing a tournament. After all, winning a match is one thing, but winning a long tournament requires a lot more skill (and some amount of luck!).</p>

<p>So we poured through the official rules and regulations that the official tournament hosts follow. It’s a <a href="file:///D:\WEBPAGES\PUBG\pubg doc.pdf" target="_blank" <span>27 page document</span></a> that requires meticulous reading to understand the nuances of turning PUBG Mobile into an eSports. There’s even a big debate about whether the battle royale game can even be considered as a viable eSports game, considering how there’s a good amount of luck involved in the beginning of the game, but that calls for another story. But considering the popularity of the game, and the host of tournaments already conducted, it’s safe to say PUBG Mobile tournaments are here to stay. Take a look at the key rules and format of the tournament here, so that you can either host your own tournament or practice for the big arena </p>

<div style="background-color:lightgray;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:120%;height:200px;"><h2><br>QUALIFICATION ROUNDS</h2>
<p style="margin-left:10px;">In official tournaments like the PUBG Mobile Club Open, teams compete against other teams in its region for a spot in the finals. There’s also a qualifying round for it. For instance, for the PUBG Mobile Club Open, there was a separate PUBG Mobile Crew Challenge that served as the qualification round. There, teams with highest cumulative scores from 8 out of 12 tournament games can qualify for the next round.

There can also be an online-only qualification round where teams are required to play a set number of games on their own and the teams with the highest scores will be selected.</p></div>

<div style="background-color:lightgray; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:120%;height:220px;"><h2><br>REGULAR SEASON</h2>
<p style="margin-left:10px;">Once qualified, players enter the regular season. During this time, 32 teams will compete in “regular season matches”. Each game will have 16 teams. They are usually played during the weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). The regular season is broken up into three stages — Group Stage, Semi-Finals, Finals.

Group Stage — Each of the 32 teams plays 12 tournament games and the top 24 teams based on cumulative scores proceed to the semi-finals.

Semi-Finals — Each of the 24 qualifying teams will play 16 tournament games and the top 16 teams with the highest cumulative scores will advance to the finals.

Finals — Each of the 16 teams will play 8 to 12 games to determine the champion. This can either be played online or via LAN.</p></div>

<div style="background-color:lightgray;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:120%;height:190px;"><h2><br> SCORING SYSTEM</h2>
<p style="margin-left:10px;">Scoring is based on each team’s final kill count and in-game placement. 1 kill counts as 1 point. The final placement of teams are also taken into account. If there is a tie between two teams during any phase, the winner will be decided on the basis of total accumulated kills across all tournament games, best performing tournament game based on total points, best performing tournament game based on total kills, total kills in the last-played tournament game and placement in the last-played tournament game.</p>
